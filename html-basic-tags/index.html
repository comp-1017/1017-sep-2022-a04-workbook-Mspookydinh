        <!--if you wish to use a component of a reserved tag( or whole tag) you would be in trouble using the tag

        <h3>Anchor tag ( a.k.a. linking to another page)</h3>
        <!--Block paired
            This is a anchor tag and is incorrectly and often referred to as the link tag
                one should not use the link tag because there is actually a <link>
                used in the head section
            the anchor tag can take you to a different location whether it be a different website, different page in the current website
            or a different a different location on the current page

            Parameters:
            href: points to the desired location
            target: indicates the browser page display option
                defualt is the same page tab
                _blank will open a new browser tab (page)
        -->
        <a href="https://www.nait.ca" target="_blank">go to Nait</a>

        <h3>Image tag</h3>
        <!--an empty (void) tag
            Image tag does not have a closing tag
                the image tag has no content, however it does have parameters
            
            parameters
            src="relative web site location"
            alt="printable text if the image is not found at src"
            [title="tool tip text for the image"]

            Absolute addressing is a complete fixed file path
                drive:/folder/..../folder/filename.ext

            a relative address begins at a specified point for websites, it is the "top of the website"
                reference to the desired filename is done by specifying the appropiate folder path to the desired file
            NO DRIVE
            
            movement with a relative address
            - if only the file name is given the location is within the same folder
            -movement down the file structure is by /foldername
            -movement up the file structure is by using " .. " for each folder level to a ascend 

            same folder
            ="filename.ext"

            lower folder
            ="nextleveldownfoldername/nextleveldownfoldername/.../filename.ext"

            from one lower folder to another to another lower folder on a different branch
            ".." for each level that need to be ascended
            ="../../../nextleveldownfoldername/filename.ext"

        <img src="img/photoshop.png" alt="logo photoshop"
            title="a logo image og photoshop">

            <!--
                combine the anchor tag and the image tag as the anchor tag content
